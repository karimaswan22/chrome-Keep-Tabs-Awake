# Project Title

## Overview

No Tab Throttle is the ultimate Chrome extension to **prevent Chrome tab throttling**, **keep background timers accurate**, and **ensure tabs stay awake**.  
It solves the problem of Chrome delaying `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in inactive tabs, making it ideal for automation scripts, dashboards, real-time apps, and background tasks.

> ⚠️ Warning: This extension may interfere with some websites. Disable it after completing your development or automation tasks.

## Features

- Prevents **Chrome background tab throttling**  
- Keeps **setTimeout** and **setInterval** timers accurate in inactive tabs  
- Keeps tabs **awake** even when Chrome would normally throttle them  
- Works automatically on **all websites**  
- Minimal and lightweight — no external dependencies  
- Takes effect immediately after installation  
- Easy to disable via Chrome extensions panel

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Chrome browser  
- Developer mode enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### Steps

1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`  
3. Enable **Developer mode**.  
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

> ✅ Works immediately after installation. No additional setup needed.

## Usage

- Timers in background tabs run **accurately** immediately.  
- Tabs are kept awake automatically.  
- Small interval test: 100ms timers run reliably.  

### To Disable

- Go to `chrome://extensions/`  
- Toggle off or remove **No Tab Throttle**  

> ⚠️ Disable after development or automation tasks to avoid interference with some websites.

## How It Works

Chrome throttles background timers to save CPU and battery. In inactive tabs:

- `setTimeout` and `setInterval` can be delayed by **seconds or minutes**  
- Automation scripts, dashboards, and real-time apps can fail  

**No Tab Throttle** uses a **Web Worker** to:

- Run timers independently of the tab state  
- Keep background scripts reliable  
- Ensure timers fire accurately  

> Developers can temporarily restore native timers using `window.WorkerTimers.disable()`.

## Common Issues & Tips

- Timers still delayed? Ensure the extension is active and Chrome is not in power-saving mode.  
- Some websites may behave unexpectedly; disable the extension after finishing tasks.  
- Works best for automation scripts, dashboards, monitoring apps, bots, and real-time updates.
